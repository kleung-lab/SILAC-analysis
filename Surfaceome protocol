•	PBS pH 6.5 at 4°C (pre-chill)
•	Aniline (amines Sigma #242284)
Steps:
1.	Grow adherent cells to full confluence (~20x106/mL).

3.	Spin/wash twice into 1mL PBS pH 6.5
4.	Resuspend cells with 1mL PBS into a 1.5mL or 2mL eppf
5.	Add 10µL NalO4 stock to final concentration of 1.6 – 2.0 mM
6.	Gently rotate at 4C˚ for 20min. Keep in dark with aluminum foil.
7.	Spin/wash with 1mL PBS 3 times.
8.	Resuspend cell pellet in 1mL PBS + 10mM Aniline (1:1000) + 1mM Biocytin hydrazide (1:100).
9.	Gently rotate at 4C˚ for 90min.
10.	Spin/wash 3 times with 1mL PBS 3 times, wash more if cell pellet is more than 300µl in tube
11.	Flash freeze the cells at -80C˚ without buffer.

Notes: Adherent cells were grown in 500cm2 plates, and harvested by addition of 15mL versene for 30 minutes followed by vigorous pipetting or scrapping. Do NOT use trypsin/enzymes to lift.

Day 2 surface protein enrichment and trypsin digestion
Chemicals:
•	Commercial RIPA lysis buffer with 1mM fresh EDTA, protease inhibitors (Sigma #P8340)
•	Make RIPA buffer with EDTA to wash (100ml x number of samples)
•	PBS at pH 7.4 + 1M NaCl (with 10x PBS and 5M NaCl stock)
•	2M Urea in 50mM ABC, freshly prepared (make 2M urea in water, add 10x ABC)
•	High capacity Neutravidin resin agarose (cold room) (Thermo #29204)
•	0.5M TCEP stock in water, stored at -20C. (Kurt’s stock 3 box)
•	0.5M iodoacetamide (IAM) MW185.98 - 10.9mgs of IAM in 117.86µl in ABC+2M urea, freshly prepared, keep in dark. (in common fridge door, middle shelf)
Steps:
1.	Wash 500µL 50% Slurry Neutravidin High Capacity with RIPA, incubate for ~1hr.
2.	Resuspend/lyse cells with 1mL RIPA with 1mM EDTA (Commercial).  Rotating at 4C˚ 30min.
3.	Sonicate for 1min (thin tip, 1 sec on, 1 sec off, 20% power) to break DNA.
4.	Spin at full speed using benchtop centrifuge for 10min at 4C˚. Collect supernatant.
5.	Mix the lysate with the Neutravidin resin. 4C˚ for 1hr, gently rotating.
6.	Put the Neutravidin resin into a gravity column (BioRad #7321010), remove all bubbles. 
7.	Wash with: 
	a. 50mL RIPA
	b. 50mL PBS + 1M NaCl
	c. 50mL ABC + 2M urea (Prepared fresh) 
	Wash with 10mL of buffer at a time and use caution to remove all bubbles from the walls of the gravity column. Could attach gravity column to a vacuum manifold.
8.	Collect the Neutravidin resin in 1.0 mL ABC without urea in a dark 1.5mL eppf.
9.	Add ~11µL TCEP stock, final concentration ~ 5mM. Incubate at 55C, 300 rpm, 30 min.
10.	Add ~22µL IAM, final concentration ~ 11mM. Shaking at room temp, 30min, keep in dark. (fresh stock: 10.9mgs of IAM in 117.86µl ABC)
11.	Spin down beads and wash/re-suspend in 1ml ABC + 2M urea.
12.	Add 20µg trypsin (1 full tube), shaking at RT, 300 rpm, overnight.

Day 3 PNGase cleavage
Chemicals:
•	PNGaseF (glycerol free), NEB #P0705S. (store in orange rack in 4°C fridge)
•	50mM Ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) in water (with 10x ABC stock)
Steps:
1.	Put the resin in a spin column. Collect the flow through (tryptic peptides). Collect with additional 250µL ABC +2M urea. Ready to de-salt.
2.	Put resin in gravity column and wash resin with: 
	a. 50mL RIPA
	b. 50mL PBS + 1M NaCl
	c. 50mL ABC + 2M urea, end with 10mL ABC 
3.	Resuspend resin in 500uL ABC (without urea) in a eppf. 
4.	Add 5uL PNGaseF. Shake at 37C for 3 hrs.
5.	Put the resin in a spin column. Collect the flow through (PNGaseF cleaved peptides) with additional 250µL washes of ABC without urea 2 times.
Note: Elute tryptic/PNGase peptides using Pierce™ Spin Columns (Thermos 69725), not gravity columns as the gravity column filter contains polymers.
 
Desalting with SOLA columns (day 3.5 or day 4)
Chemicals (in drawers):
•	100% acetonitrile (ACN)
•	10% TFA in water
•	0.1% formic acid (FA), keep in dark
•	40% ACN + 0.1% FA, keep in dark
•	2% ACN + 0.1% FA, keep in dark
Steps:
1.	Acidify samples to pH < 2 (~1% TFA) by adding 10% TFA, check with pH paper
2.	Spin down samples at max speed for 10 mins
3.	Desalt as follow: 
1.	Activate SOLA with 500µL 100% ACN
2.	Equilibrate with 1mL 1% TFA (spin at 100g for 1 min)
3.	Load sample to SOLA column (collect flow through and load again)
4.	Wash with 500uL 1% TFA 
5.	Wash with 500uL 2% ACN+ 0.1% FA 
6.	Elute with 250µL 40% ACN + 0.1% FA x 2
7.	Genevac to dry, store frozen at -80ºC, or
8.	Re-suspend in 10µL (PNGase fraction) 2% ACN + 0.1% FA (or ~100µL for tryptic fraction)
4.	a) tryptic fraction: take concentration with nanodrop by using 1Ab = 1 mg/ml, dilute to 1µg/µL and load 1µg sample MAX. 
b) PNGase fraction: run 1hr scouting run with a 10x diluted sample to determine max sample to load (try to hit 5E9 TIC).
Note: Use Axygen MAXYMum Recovery tubes (MCT-060-L-C, MCT-200-L-C), Neptune S3 tips (2372.S, 2102S, 2342S3.S), Optima LC/MS grade water (W64).
